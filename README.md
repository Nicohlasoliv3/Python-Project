# Python Project (Quiz Game)

## Objective

The Python Journal Project aimed to develop a multiple-choice quiz game that tests knowledge on specific topics through multiple-choice questions. The project provided skills necessary for defining problems, working through examples, generalizing into pseudocode, testing programs, and commenting code.

### Scenario
You are a developer tasked with creating a quiz game in Python that presents multiple-choice questions, accepts user answers, provides feedback, and keeps track of the score.

### Skills Learned

- Problem Definition
- Example-driven Development
- Pseudocode Creation
- Program Testing
- Code Commenting

### Tools Used

- Python
- Replit for code implementation and testing

## Steps

## Step 1: Define Your Problem
- Objective: Create a quiz game to test knowledge on various topics using multiple-choice questions.
- Key Takeaways:
  - Clearly defining the problem ensures the scope and requirements are well-understood.
  - Inputs include a set of questions with multiple-choice answers.
  - Outputs include user feedback and the final score.

## Step 2: Work Through Specific Examples
- Task: Break down the problem into specific examples.
- Key Examples:
  - Example 1: "What is the capital of France?" with options and correct answer tracking.
  - Example 2: "What is 2 + 2?" with options and correct answer tracking.
- Key Takeaways:
  - Working through examples helps in understanding how to handle various scenarios and edge cases.

## Step 3: Generalize Into Pseudocode
- Task: Write pseudocode for the entire program.

- Key Takeaways:
  - Pseudocode helps in planning the program structure and logic before actual implementation.
  - It includes initializing the score, defining questions, iterating through questions, accepting user input, checking answers, providing feedback, and displaying the final score.

## Step 4: Test Your Program
- Task: Describe the testing process, record errors, and approaches to fix them.
- Key Takeaways:
  - Comprehensive testing ensures the program works as expected and handles edge cases.
  - Documenting errors and fixes helps in understanding common pitfalls and improving the code.

## Step 5: Commenting Your Program
- Task: Ensure the program code is well-commented.

- Key Takeaways:
  - Well-commented code is easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
  - Each section of the code should have comments explaining the functionality and logic.

## Step 6: Your Completed Program
- Task: Implement the final quiz game with all functionalities.
- Key Takeaways:
  - The completed program should be functional, well-documented, and thoroughly tested.
  - Sharing the program on platforms like Replit allows for easy demonstration and review.
